## **Supermarket Sales Analysis (Mentorship Cohort 1 Project)**
##
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a supermarket sales dataset to uncover patterns and factors that influence total sales performance. The analysis was carried out using Python in a Google Colab environment as part of the 3MTT/Deeptech Cohort 1 Mentorship programme.

The goal of the project is to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to derive meaningful business insights from transactional sales data.

##
🎯 Objectives

Explore the structure and quality of the dataset

Identify key factors that affect total sales

Analyze relationships between variables such as:

Quantity sold

Product line

City/branch

Visualize trends and correlations in the data

Draw data-driven conclusions from observed patterns

##
📊 Dataset

Name: SuperMarket Analysis Dataset

Format: CSV

Content: Transaction-level sales data including quantity sold, product categories, sales values, and location details.

The dataset is loaded directly into the notebook and checked for:

Data types

Missing values

Basic statistical properties


##
🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – data loading and manipulation

Matplotlib – data visualization

Seaborn – statistical visualizations

##
🔍 Methodology

Data Loading

Imported the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Data Inspection

Checked shape, column types, missing values, and summary statistics.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Examined relationships between quantity and total sales.

Used correlation analysis to understand variable dependencies.

Visualization

Created plots to visually assess trends and patterns in the data.

Insights & Interpretation

Interpreted findings to understand which factors significantly affect total sales.

##
📈 Key Insights

Total sales are strongly influenced by quantity sold.

Some categorical features (such as product line and city) show minimal influence on overall sales distribution.

A clear positive correlation exists between quantity and sales, confirming expected business logic.


##
📌 Project Status

✔ Completed
This project focuses on exploratory analysis and insight generation rather than predictive modeling.
